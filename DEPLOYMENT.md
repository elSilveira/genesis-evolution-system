# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## âœ… Your project is now ready for GitHub Pages!

### What was configured:

1. **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)**
   - Added proper base path for GitHub Pages deployment
   - Configured to use `/genesis-evolution-system/` as base path in production

2. **Package.json Updates**
   - Added `gh-pages` dependency for manual deployment
   - Added `deploy` script for manual deployment

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**
   - Automatic deployment on push to main branch
   - Uses Node.js 18 and npm ci for fast, reliable builds
   - Deploys built files to gh-pages branch

4. **Client-Side Routing Support**
   - Added 404.html fallback for single-page app routing
   - Updated index.html with GitHub Pages SPA routing script
   - Modified App.tsx to use correct basename for production

5. **Build Scripts**
   - Added `build.sh` and `build.bat` for local testing
   - Updated README with deployment instructions

### How to deploy:

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
4. Push to main branch - automatic deployment will trigger
5. Your site will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/genesis-evolution-system/`

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### Testing locally:
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Important Notes:
- The project uses `/genesis-evolution-system/` as the base path in production
- All routes are properly configured for GitHub Pages
- The build is optimized and ready for deployment
- Client-side routing works correctly with GitHub Pages

Your project is fully configured and ready to deploy! ðŸš€
